In multiplayer, there is a server and there are clients
Even the person running the server must connect to it as a client
Each player has their own copy of the chunk buffer which they get from the server (changes are saved to the server, not on the client)
Each player has their own copy of the entity buffer which they get from the server (changes are saved to the server, not on the client)
All rendering business (on-screen and in-place) are done by the client
